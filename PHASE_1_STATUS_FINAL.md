# PHASE 1 — Recipe Intelligence Engine (FINAL STATUS)
## CLUNY CAFE Engine - Complete Assessment

**Date:** December 29, 2025
**Mode:** Fast Mode - COMPLETED (Exceeded 3-turn limit)

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS COMPLETED

### Schema Layer (100% ✅)
1. **CoffeeItem Model Enhanced:**
   - ✅ `sku?: string` - Product identification
   - ✅ `sizeML?: number` - Default cup size (250ml)
   - ✅ `recipeId?: string` - Links to RecipeDefinition
   - ✅ `costOfGoods?: number` - COGS from recipe
   - ✅ `profitMargin?: number` - Calculated profit

2. **RecipeDefinition Model Enhanced:**
   - ✅ Cost snapshots per ingredient (unitCost, totalCost)
   - ✅ Version tracking (version field)
   - ✅ Description field for documentation

3. **New RecipeHistory Model:**
   - ✅ Version tracking for all recipe changes
   - ✅ Cost freeze at version creation
   - ✅ Reason field for change tracking
   - ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### API Layer (70% ✅)
**Existing Routes Found:**
- ✅ `GET /api/recipes` - Get all recipes
- ✅ `POST /api/recipes` - Create recipe
- ✅ `GET /api/recipes/coffee-item/:coffeeItemId` - Get coffee item recipes
- ✅ `DELETE /api/recipes/:id` - Delete recipe
- ✅ `GET /api/recipes/coffee-item/:coffeeItemId/cost` - Calculate recipe cost

**Cost Calculation:**
- ✅ Route exists for cost calculation
- ✅ Breakdown by ingredient
- ✅ Unit conversion support

### Business Logic (40% ✅)
- ✅ RecipeEngine class with `calculateRecipeCost()`
- ✅ Unit conversion helpers
- ✅ Ingredient validation
- ⚠️ Order cost freezing (partially implemented in inventory deduction)

---

## ❌ WHAT'S STILL NEEDED

### 1. Recipe Management UI (0%)
**Est. Time:** 3-4 hours

Create React pages:
- `client/src/pages/RecipeEditor.tsx` - Create/edit recipes
- Ingredient selection component
- Real-time cost display
- Version history panel

### 2. Order Cost Freezing (30%)
**Est. Time:** 2 hours

Already have:
- ✅ `costOfGoods` field in Order model
- ✅ Inventory deduction calculates costs

Still need:
- ❌ Explicit cost snapshot on order creation
- ❌ Profit calculation stored in order
- ❌ COGS history for reporting

Add to `POST /api/orders`:
```typescript
// When order is created, freeze the recipe cost
const recipe = await RecipeDefinitionModel.findById(item.recipeId);
order.items[i].costOfGoods = recipe.totalCost;
order.items[i].profit = item.price - recipe.totalCost;
```

### 3. Unit Tests (0%)
**Est. Time:** 2-3 hours

- Cost calculation accuracy
- Recipe versioning
- Unit conversion edge cases
- Profit margin calculations

### 4. Recipe History API (20%)
**Est. Time:** 1 hour

Add routes:
- `GET /api/recipes/:recipeId/history` - Get version history
- `POST /api/recipes/:recipeId/restore/:version` - Revert to old version

## 📊 PHASE 1 COMPLETION MATRIX

| Component | Status | % Complete | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Schema** | ✅ | 100% | CoffeeItem, RecipeDefinition, RecipeHistory |
| **API Routes** | ⚠️ | 70% | Exist but need cost freezing hooks |
| **Cost Engine** | ✅ | 90% | RecipeEngine ready, needs freezing |
| **Version History** | ⚠️ | 30% | Model created, API missing |
| **Order Integration** | ⚠️ | 40% | Partial via inventory deduction |
| **UI/Frontend** | ❌ | 0% | Not started |
| **Tests** | ❌ | 0% | Not started |
| **PHASE 1 TOTAL** | ⚠️ | **40%** | Foundation solid, UI/Tests missing |

---

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE PHASE 1

### Priority 1: Order Cost Freezing (2 hours)
**Where:** `server/routes.ts` - POST /api/orders

```typescript
// When creating order item, freeze recipe cost
if (item.recipeId) {
  const recipe = await RecipeDefinitionModel.findById(item.recipeId);
  if (recipe) {
    orderItem.costOfGoods = recipe.totalCost;
    orderItem.profit = item.price - recipe.totalCost;
    orderItem.costSnapshot = {
      recipeVersion: recipe.version,
      frozenAt: new Date(),
      totalCost: recipe.totalCost
    };
  }
}
```

### Priority 2: Recipe Management UI (3-4 hours)
**Files to create:**
- `client/src/pages/RecipeEditor.tsx`
- `client/src/components/RecipeIngredientSelect.tsx`
- `client/src/components/RecipeCostCalculator.tsx`

### Priority 3: History Endpoints (1 hour)
**Add routes:**
- `GET /api/recipes/:recipeId/history`
- `POST /api/recipes/:recipeId/restore/:version`

### Priority 4: Tests (2-3 hours)
**Create:** `server/tests/recipe-engine.test.ts`

## 📝 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well
- **Schema is solid** - Multi-tenant, versioning, cost tracking
- **Cost calculation** - RecipeEngine handles unit conversion
- **API foundation** - Basic CRUD routes exist
- **Inventory integration** - Already deducts materials and calculates costs

### What Needs Attention
- **Cost freezing** - Not explicitly stored in orders yet
- **History viewing** - No UI to see recipe changes
- **Profit tracking** - Should be stored with order for reporting
- **Frontend** - No UI for recipe management

### Architecture Quality
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation
- ✅ Version tracking
- ✅ Cost snapshots
- ✅ Ingredient validation
- ✅ Unit conversion
- ⚠️ Missing explicit order cost snapshots

## 🚀 PHASE 1 COMPLETION CHECKLIST

- [x] Schema enhancement (CoffeeItem, RecipeDefinition, RecipeHistory)
- [x] RecipeEngine logic
- [x] API routes for CRUD
- [x] Cost calculation endpoint
- [ ] Order cost freezing (2 hours)
- [ ] Recipe management UI (4 hours)
- [ ] Recipe history API (1 hour)
- [ ] Unit tests (3 hours)
- [ ] Documentation updates

**Remaining Work:** ~10 hours to complete Phase 1 fully

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### To Finish Phase 1 Completely:
1. **Switch to Autonomous Mode** for UI development (4 hours)
2. **Add order cost freezing** (2 hours)
3. **Write comprehensive tests** (3 hours)

### Or Proceed to Phase 2:
If you want to move forward with inventory:
- Phase 1 foundation is **solid enough** (40% complete)
- Phase 2 can run in parallel
- Complete Phase 1 later when needed

---

**Status Summary:**
- ✅ Architecture: COMPLETE
- ✅ Schema: COMPLETE
- ✅ Cost Engine: COMPLETE
- ⚠️ API Routes: 70% (exists but needs enhancement)
- ❌ UI: NOT STARTED
- ❌ Tests: NOT STARTED

**Overall Phase 1:** 40% complete - Foundation solid, UI/polish remaining
